## How It Works

### Jianpu to Flute Conversion

The flute in *Animal Well* is played using 8 directions on a controller, corresponding to the 8 notes of a C Major scale. The game also allows for pitch modification: holding the button that corresponds to note `1` while playing another note lowers its pitch by an octave, and holding the button for note `3` raises it by a semitone. This tool works by mapping the provided Jianpu notation to these in-game directional inputs, including the necessary holds for pitch shifting.

-   **Parse**: It reads the `jianpu` list from a `.yaml` song file.
-   **Convert**: It translates each Jianpu symbol (e.g., `5`, `h1`, `(3 2)`) into its corresponding directional input, applying any necessary transposition based on the chosen strategy.
-   **Play**: It displays the final directional sequence in the command line, providing a clear guide for in-game performance.

### Jianpu Auto Importer

This feature leverages a **multimodal large language model (MLLM)** to provide an end-to-end solution for converting Jianpu images directly into the project's `.yaml` song format. The MLLM handles the entire process seamlessly: it analyzes the image, recognizes the musical notation, and generates the final, structured `.yaml` content, automating the transcription process from start to finish.

```

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ADAning/animal-well-flute.git
    cd animal-well-flute
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    It is recommended to use a virtual environment.
    
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

The tool is operated via `cli.py`.

### Interactive Mode

For a more user-friendly experience, you can run the tool in interactive mode. This provides a text-based user interface (TUI) to navigate through all available functions.

To start the interactive mode, run:
```bash
python cli.py interactive
```

### List Available Songs

To see all the songs currently in your `songs/` directory:

```bash
python cli.py list
```

### Play a Song

To "play" a song from your library, use the `play` command followed by the song's name. If you omit the song name, the tool will enter an interactive selection menu.

```bash
# Play a specific song
python cli.py play travelers

# Enter interactive mode to select a song
python cli.py play --interactive
```

This will output the directional sequence to your terminal.

**Additional Parameters:**

- `--bpm <number>`: Override the song's default BPM.
- `--ready-time <seconds>`: Set a custom countdown time before playing (in seconds).

**Example:**
```bash
python cli.py play travelers --bpm 100 --ready-time 5
```

#### Advanced: Choosing a Conversion Strategy

Some songs may contain notes that are outside the flute's default playable range. The `--strategy` flag allows you to control how the tool handles these cases by transposing the song.

```bash
python cli.py play <song_name> --strategy <strategy_name> [parameter]
```

**Available Strategies:**

- **`auto [high|low|optimal]`**: Automatically selects the best strategy among `high`, `low`, and `optimal`. You can provide an optional preference (e.g., `auto high`).
  - **`optimal` (Default):** Automatically calculates the best pitch shift (transposition) to fit the maximum number of notes into the flute's range.
  - **`high`**: Prefers to transpose the song to a higher pitch.
  - **`low`**: Prefers to transpose the song to a lower pitch.
- **`manual <offset / song>`**: Manually specify a pitch shift in semitones. The `<offset>` can be a positive or negative number (e.g., `1.5`, `-2.0`). Or specify the offset in the song.
- **`none`**: Applies no transposition (`manual 0.0`).

**Example:**

If you want to play directly without adding complicated settings:

```bash
python cli.py play your_song
```

This is equivalent to using `--strategy auto optimal` by default.

If a song sounds too high, you can try playing it with a lower transposition:

```bash
python cli.py play your_song --strategy low
```

Or, manually transpose it down by two semitones:

```bash
python cli.py play your_song --strategy manual -2.0
```

If you wish to use the default offset in a specific song (if any):

```bash
python cli.py play your_song --strategy manual song
```

### Analyze a Song

To analyze a song's musical properties, such as its note range and optimal transposition, use the `analyze` command. This is useful for understanding how a song will be converted before you play it.

```bash
# Analyze a specific song
python cli.py analyze travelers

# Enter interactive mode to select a song to analyze
python cli.py analyze --interactive
```
The output will show the song's pitch range and provide suggestions for the best conversion strategies.

### Importing a Song from an Image (Experimental)

This tool can use AI to recognize a Jianpu image and automatically convert it into the `.yaml` song format.

**Setup:**

This feature requires an API key for either Google Gemini or Doubao. You must set the corresponding environment variable:

-   **For Gemini**: `GOOGLE_API_KEY`
-   **For Doubao**: `ARK_API_KEY`

> **Note**: Please use `GOOGLE_API_KEY` for the Gemini service. This specific variable name is used to avoid conflicts with other tools, such as `gemini-cli`, which may use `GEMINI_API_KEY`.

You can check the status of the AI services with:
```bash
python cli.py ai-status
```

**Usage:**

To import a song, use the `import` command. You can provide a path to a single image file or a directory.

```bash
# Import a single image
python cli.py import path/to/your/song.png

# Import all images from a directory (defaults to the 'sheets/' directory)
python cli.py import
```

**Additional Parameters:**
- `--ai-provider <gemini|doubao>`: Specify which AI service to use.
- `--output-dir <path>`: Specify a custom output directory for the generated `.yaml` file.
- `--debug`: Display detailed debugging information, including the raw response from the AI model. This is useful for troubleshooting.

-   **Automatic Merging**: If a directory contains multiple images, the tool will treat them as pages of the same song and merge them into a single `.yaml` file. The images are processed in alphabetical order.

**Note**: This is an experimental feature. The AI-generated `.yaml` file may require manual corrections for accuracy.

## Song File Format

Songs are defined in `.yaml` files using a format based on **Jianpu**.

**Keys:**

- `name` (string): The name of the song.
- `bpm` (integer): The tempo of the song in beats per minute.
- `jianpu` (list of strings): The core of the song, written in a specialized Jianpu format. Each string in the list typically represents a bar of music.
- `offset` (float, optional): A default transposition in semitones for the song.
- `description` (string, optional): A brief description or note about the song.

**Jianpu Format Details:**

The `jianpu` format uses numbers `1-7` to represent notes. Special characters and notations are used for rhythm, octaves, and rests:

- **Octaves**: `h` for high (e.g., `h1`), `l` for low (e.g., `l6`).
- **Rhythm**: Parentheses `()` are used for shorter notes, and `d` might indicate a dotted note (e.g., `5d`).
- **Rests**: `0` represents a rest.

**Example (`songs/travelers.yaml`):**

```yaml
name: Travelers
bpm: 90
offset: 0.0
jianpu:
- 1 5 7 (0 5) | (h1 7) (6 5) (6 7) 5 | 
- 2 5 7 (0 5) | (h1 7) (6 5) (6 7) (h2 7) |
- 3 5 7 (0 5) | (h1 7) (6 5) (6 7) 5 |
- 2 5 7 (0 5) | (h1 7) (6 5) (6 7) (h2 7) |
